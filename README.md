# Bayesian_Summer_Study

## [Purpose](https://github.com/rmcelreath/stat_rethinking_2022/blob/main/README.md#purpose).

“This course teaches data analysis, but it focuses on scientific models first. The unfortunate truth about data is that nothing much can be done with it, until we say what caused it. We will prioritize conceptual, causal models and precise questions about those models. We will use Bayesian data analysis to connect scientific models to evidence. And we will learn powerful computational tools for coping with high-dimension, imperfect data of the kind that biologists and social scientists face.”

## [Coding Updates + Conversions](https://github.com/rmcelreath/stat_rethinking_2022/blob/main/README.md#coding).

“This course involves a lot of scripting. Students can engage with the material using either the original R code examples or one of several conversions to other computing environments. The conversions are not always exact, but they are rather complete. Each option is listed below. I also list conversions <[here](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/)>.” Updates & conversions include:

* R + Tidyverse + ggplot2 + brms.

* Python.

* Julia & Turing.
